# Changelog

All notable changes to unreleased-guard are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); this project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-04

> **Published without provenance, and only this version.** npm's trusted
> publishing is configured from an existing package's settings page, so it cannot
> create a package that has never been published: the first publish has to come
> from an authenticated session, which cannot mint an OIDC attestation. From the
> next version the release workflow owns it and every release carries SLSA
> provenance naming the commit that built it. There is no GitHub Release for this
> version either, because cutting one by hand stamps an operator's personal
> account onto a page that cannot be edited afterwards.

### Added

- **The skill is installable.** `npx unreleased-guard` copies `SKILL.md` and its
  `references/` into `./.claude/skills/unreleased-guard/`, with `--global`, `--dir`,
  `--check`, `--print`, `--uninstall` and `--force`. The installer reads every
  byte back after writing it and fails if what landed is not what it wrote, and
  it prints how many files it installed rather than only that it succeeded.
- Three exit codes rather than two: 0 installed or already identical, 1 present
  and different, 2 could not run at all. "It differs" and "I could not do this"
  are different answers and collapsing them is how a broken install reads as a
  clean one.
- CI on four cells (Ubuntu and Windows, Node 20 and 24), including an end to end
  run that packs the package the way npm would, installs it from that tarball,
  and installs the skill from there.

### Notes

- The skill's own content did not change for this release. It grades A(100) on
  `efaimo check --skill` before and after, and the package version and the
  version in `SKILL.md` frontmatter are one number, pinned by a test.
